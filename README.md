I'm from Chicago, IL and I'm excited to welcome you to my GitHub portfolio! Here you'll find some of my favorite projects, like my work on Advent of Code, an ImageProcessor, and a Chess game that I'm still working on.

I'm currently looking for a co-op through Northeastern's co-op program in the time-frame of July-December 2023 in a software engineer/developer role!
