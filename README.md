  public Jekhi5 {
    this.name = "Jacob Kline";
    this.pronouns = String[3]{"He", "Him", "His"};

I'm a queer nerd from Chicago, IL and I'm excited to welcome you to my GitHub portfolio! Here you'll find some of my favorite projects, like my work on a SNAP Benefit compliant grocery store locator, Advent of Code, and a Chess game that I'm still working on.

I'm a student at Northeastern University, currently working as a software engineering co-op at Wood Mackenzie in their Boston office!
